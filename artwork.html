                    <h1>Kay Nielsen's Sheherezade</h1>
                  </header>
                  <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                  <p>As you saw in Keller's painting, Shahryar blends with the background with dark colors, while all the light and finery is reserved for Scheherazade. Hidden behind the colorful bird and flowers, Shahryar is almost an afterthought to the Keller, but at second glance, his import is more apparent. His robe becomes transitions almost imperceptibly to the castle, the symbols of his grandeur and power. Yet as he stares in awe at Scheherazade, she is the one who holds power over her. Captivated by her stories, Shahryar fades to the background. </p>
                  <p>In Nielsen's painting, Scheherazade is the character who still draws the light and the viewer's eyes initially, but Shahryiar plays a much more prominent role. Seated on his throne looming over the canvas, the Sultan holds Scheherazade's fate in his hands. He could crush her without a second thought, and her delicate, submissive posture and nakedness in the work lend themselves to Shahryar's brutish portrayal. </p>
                  <p>The dark night and Shahryar's dim colors, similarly to Keller's painting, blend together to forebodingly contrast Scheherazade's beauty. Once again the King is there to support and create an environment in which Scheherazade can shine. </p>

          <!-- Two -->
            <section id="two">
              <div class="inner">
                <header class="major">
                  <h1>Shahryar in Detouche's Scheherazade</h1>
                </header>
                <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic14.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p> Here the contrast of the two paintings is startling. No longer is Shahryar the sinister character lurking over Scheherazade. Now Shahyar laughs along with Scheherazad and Dunyazad, the three of them light and at complete ease together. The transition from Neoclassical to Romantic style is apparent in the light, romanesque characters. The love of Shahryar and Scheherazade makes the audience wonder at what stage in the 1001 nights are they? Has the King already made up his mind to marry Scheherazade? Is he judging her stories still, and she in the precariious position of being killed if she fails to perform?</p>
                <p>The character of Dunyazad in this painting is interesting. At first glance, Dunyazad is sitting on the couch. However, the person on the couch has a larger, more ornate crown, so perhaps Shahryar is sitting with Dunyazad actually, and Scheherazade is watching fondly as her sister talks with Shahryar. </p>
                <p>The Arabian Nights and its adaptations are ripe for interpretation, and Shahryar is one character who is so flexible, because no one really knows, until the end, what he is thinking.  </p>
