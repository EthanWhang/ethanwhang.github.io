                  <p>The goal of this website is to explore the king Shahryar from the frame story in Arabian Night. With such an iconic character as Scheherazade in the story, it is easy to write off Shahryar as simply the audience. I see Shahryar as a character with underappreciated depth, someone who is always present in the story but without much tangible action.</p>
                  <p>For such a complicated and wide-spreading work like Arabian Nights, it can be overwhelming at first. A successful website will narrow down everything that the audience needs to focus on. By choosing to only analyze Shahryar, I think that this makes the information that is passed in much easier to process. Aditionally, this highlights how much there is in Atabian Nights. Think of all the interpretations of Scheherazade, and the inflence that she has had on culture today and in the past. </p>
                  <p>The interactive take on a character analysis was inspired by the framing for each class: the different mediums of the frames and how they highlighted and uncovered parts of the texts, original and adaptations.</p>
                  <p>To create this website I started with a template, and then added it to a GitHub repository.</p>
