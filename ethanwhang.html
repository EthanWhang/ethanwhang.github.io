                    <h1>The Narrative of this Website</h1>

                  <p>The goal of this website is twofold: to explore the sultan Shahryar from the frame story in Arabian Night and to test out the waters of what a website can do for bringing together a variety of sources. After working with so many mediums in class, from paintings to recordings to videos to original texts to modern texts, the connections between different adaptations of Arabian Nights and prevalent themes begin to appear. My original idea was a sort of database with all the texts and sources that we used in class and more, which would be helpful, especially after using a website like the one where the English translations of the original text are available. However, I decided that in order to really explore the crossover between the Arabian Nights text and Computer Science, I could make a narrative in the website. Thus I needed to focus my “argument,” so to speak, and take a more manageable amount of sources to bring together in the most comprehensive way. The interactive take on a character analysis was inspired by the framing for each class: the different mediums of the frames and how they highlighted and uncovered parts of the texts, original and adaptations.</p>
                  <p>For such a complicated and wide-spreading work like Arabian Nights, it was overwhelming at first. A successful website will narrow down everything that the audience needs to focus on. By choosing to only analyze Shahryar, I think that this makes the information that is passed in much easier to process. Additionally, this highlights how much there is in Arabian Nights. Think of all the interpretations of Scheherazade, and the influence that she has had on culture today and in the past. Indeed, while working on the website I kept on wanting to add more and more pages, and more and more comparisons, but had to cut myself short because of time constraints! </p>
                  <p>With such an iconic character as Scheherazade in the story, it is easy to write off Shahryar as simply the audience. I see Shahryar as a character with underappreciated depth, someone who is always present in the story but without much tangible action.</p>
                  <p>We start with the introduction of “Who is Shahryar?” a question that is not easily answered. The flow of the website is to loosely follow the chronology of the text; when first introduced to the reader, Shahryar is the sultan of a kingdom, who then becomes the murderer and then the listening audience. These themes stick with Shahryar throughout the stories and adaptations though, so it is not a concrete, step-wise website. I wanted to make every page available at all times, because this is not meant to be a powerpoint presentation, which is why the home page has the tiles to choose from, and why every page has a menu. The idea of an interactive website is that the user is free to explore to his or her delight, and never be lost or not understand the content. </p>
                  <p>The final part of the website is the portrayals and adaptations of Shahryar in modern, and not-so-modern, art. This is meant to be a culmination of the previous identities of Shahryar the website introduces. However, it is just as valid to begin with this part of the website, although I did put buttons to move the website in a comprehensive flow for a first-time user. </p>
                  <p>I tried throughout the website to make sure that everything was in bite-size quantities, because technology should be as comprehensive as possible. The blending of mediums was especially interesting, putting recordings with pictures, videos with text. In the listener section, the viewer becomes Shahryar while reading the text and looking at the pictures, hearing the stories as the sultan would have. I had to pick and choose what pieces of art I compared with the last page, but think of it more of a sampling for what the potential is rather than the only important interpretations. </p>
                  <p>I think that it would be really interesting to open up this repository to the public and see how people update and edit it - what sort of additions they make and what pieces of art or text they choose to analyze or compare.</p>
                  <p>On a technical level, to create this website I started with a template, and then added it to a GitHub repository. It took a lot of time to format the website, and I wish that I had more time in order to flesh out every one of the pages. I had to really research and play around with the video and audio embedding, because I have never worked with something like that before. There is an infinite amount of exploring that can be done through a website! From art to music to text, the sources are at everyone's fingertips. It was challenging to narrow the topic down, because at the same time I wanted to show at least the beginning of what a comprehensive digital platform could achieve. </p>
                  <p>On a more personal note, this was the first time I was working in HTML and CSS completely on my own, and am much more confident in my ability to create a website, starting with a template again or also from scratch, in the future. Thank you and I hope you enjoyed the website!</p>
